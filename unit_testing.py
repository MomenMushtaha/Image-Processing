def check_equal(description: str, outcome, expected) -> None:
    """
    Print a "passed" message if outcome and expected have same type and
    are equal (as determined by the == operator); otherwise, print a 
    "fail" message.
    
    Parameter "description" should provide information that will help us
    interpret the test results; e.g., the call expression that yields
    outcome.
    
    Parameters "outcome" and "expected" are typically the actual value returned
    by a call expression and the value we expect a correct implementation
    of the function to return, respectively. Both parameters must have the same
    type, which must be a type for which == is used to determine if two values
    are equal. Don't use this function to check if floats, lists of floats,
    tuples of floats, etc. are equal.
