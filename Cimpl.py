Cimpl provides a collection of functions for manipulating digital images.

Programmers should use the procedural interface to Cimpl; i.e., call the
"global" Colour, Image functions and file dialogue functions.

To learn about these functions, use Python's help facility:

Image functions:

>>> help(load_image)
>>> help(create_image)
>>> help(copy)
>>> help(get_width)
>>> help(get_height)
>>> help(get_color)
>>> help(set_color)
>>> help(save_as)
>>> help(save)
>>> help(set_zoom)
>>> help(show)

Colour functions:

>>> help(create_color)
>>> help(distance)

File dialogue functions:

>>> help(choose_file)
>>> help(choose_save_filename)


Do not call the methods provided by the underlying Image and Color
classes. These classes may be modified or replaced in future releases of
this module, and backwards compatibility is not guaranteed. Specifically,
class names and method names may be renamed, and classes and methods may be
replaced or deleted.

def _adjust_component(comp):
    """Return comp as an integer between 0 and 255, inclusive, returning 0
    if comp is negative and capping values >= 256 at 255.
    """
    comp = int(comp)
    return max(0, min(255, comp))

class Color(tuple):
    """An RGB color.

    When an instance is created, the RGB component values are quietly adjusted,
    as required, to ensure that they are ints in the range 0..255, inclusive.

    Examples:
      Color(120, 60, 200) yields the color (120, 60, 200)
      Color(-120, 60, 280) yields the color (0, 60, 255)
      Color(120.0, 60.5, 200.2) yields the color (120, 60, 200)

    Because Color is a subclass of tuple, Color objects can be treated as
    tuples. For example, to retrieve the rgb components stored in a Color
    object, it can be subscripted (indexed):

      col = Color(120, 60, 200)
      ...
      r = col[0]  # r is bound to 120
      g = col[1]  # g is bound to 60
      b = col[2]  # b is bound to 200

    Or, we can unpack a Color object, the same way we can unpack a tuple:

      r, g, b = col  # r is bound to 120, g is bound to 60, b is bound to 200

    To convert a Color object col to a tuple, do this:

      tuple(col)  # Returns the tuple (120, 60, 200)

        # range 0 to 255, inclusive. THIS IS NOT CHECKED.
        #
        # The preferred way for application code to convert a tuple t to a

        # This way ensures that the rgb components will be converted, if
        # necessary, to integers in the range 0..255 when the Color object is
        # initialized.

    # this doesn't happen. I haven't found an explanation for this behaviour
    # in any of the online documentation or examples for Tkinter.
