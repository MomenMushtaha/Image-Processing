Description:
An interactive program created to apply a variety of filters to an image cumulatively by the user. 

The project is made up of 4 files:
T20_image_filters.py           A python file containing the various filters
T20_interactive_ui.py          A python file containing the prompts for the user
T20_batch.ui.py	          A python file recording the filters
Cimpl.py		          A python file used to aid execution

Installation:
Python 3.7 or later must be installed, as well as a python IDE such as Wing 101, and Pillow 6.4 or later. The required modules listed above should be installed and stored in the same folder to ensure efficiency of the software.

Usage:
The software is programmed with a text-based, single character command user interface. The user is prompted to load a file (with the L command), then is able to select the filters to be applied. The user can continue to apply filters, or quit.
